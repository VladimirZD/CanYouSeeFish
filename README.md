# CanYouSeeFish

Idea is to analyze images made by water wolf video camera (for fishing) and categorize images So i don't have to watch 3hours of video to see if there was any fish  Or what kind of bottom is there :)
And by doing all this to have some fun with tensorflow and python

This scipt splits video file in images as first step in preparing sample images for training 
tensorflow. Tensorflow treining is based on tensofr flow for poets code lab https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0
For extraction of images i am using ffmpeg  https://www.ffmpeg.org/
