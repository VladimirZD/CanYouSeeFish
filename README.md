# CanYouSeeFish

Idea is to analyze images made by water wolf video camera (for fishing) and categorize images. So i don't have to watch 3hours of video to see if there was any fish or what kind of bottom is there :)
And by doing all this to have some fun with tensorflow and python.

This scipt splits video file in images as first step, then calls tensorflow for each image to try and categorize it.
Tensorflow treining is based on tensorflow for poets code lab https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0
For extraction of images i am using ffmpeg  https://www.ffmpeg.org/.
